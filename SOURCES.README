HOW TO BUILD?
=============

Preparation:

1. Create directories for build <bld>, source <src>, and install <install>
  

2. Copy the source tarballs to the corresponding directories in the following
   locations:

   <src>/binutils-src-patches/
   <src>/gcc-src-patches/
   <src>/newlib-src-patches/

   * If patched source tarballs used directly, remove prefix 'avr32-' from name.
     example: rename avr32-gcc-4.4.7.tar.gz to gcc-4.4.7.tar.gz


3. If you are using the patches, then they must also be copied to the 
   corresponding directories mentioned at [2]. In this case the source code
   tarballs should contain unmodified sources which can be obtained form their 
   respective project websites

   Note: By default, the script uses the patches and expects the tarballs to be
         clean sources obtained from their respective sites. However, if one
         wants to build using the tarballs supplied here, he may have to modify
         the build script to disable using the patches:

         Function 'apply_patches' shall be used to apply patches to source. 
         This shall be enabled/ disabled in following functions.
           a. binutils_prep()
           b. gcc_prep()
           c. newlib_prep()


4. Building the toolchain has following dependencies:

   gmp-5.0.2
   mpfr-3.0.0
   mpc-0.9

   They may be obtained from their respective project websites. The tarballs
   of these should be copied to the following directories:

   - gmp tar.gz file to <src>/gmp/
   - mpfr tar.gz file to <src>/mpfr/
   - mpc tar file to <src>/mpc/


5. In order to build, issue the following command


   sh build-avr32-gnu-toolchain.sh -b <bld> -p <install> -s <src> 


   Note 1: If the binaries are required to be installed in the default 
           directories, one may use  -P <root-passwd>  option to pass the root 
           password.

   Note 2: This current version assumes that the build environment has the 
           following present and available:

           - automake-1.11.1
           - autoconf-2.64
           - texinfo-4.13
