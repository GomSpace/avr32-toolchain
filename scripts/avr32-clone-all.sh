#		    CLONE ALL AVR32 TOOL CHAIN COMPONENTS
#		    =====================================

# Run this from the tool chain directory

# Function to clone a tool. First argument is the name of the remote, second
# is the name of the tool, third the repository to clone from.
clone_tool () {
    remote=$1
    tool=$2
    repo=$3

    # Clear out anything pre-existing and clone the repo
    rm -rf ${tool}
    git clone -o ${remote} ${repo} ${tool}
}

# Clone all the AVR32 tool components. Note that we need two copies of the
# binutils-gdb repo, to allow us to work with different versions (branches) of
# binutils and gdb
clone_tool origin binutils git@github.com:GomSpace/avr32-binutils-gdb.git
clone_tool origin gcc      git@github.com:GomSpace/avr32-gcc.git
clone_tool origin newlib   git@github.com:GomSpace/avr32-newlib.git
cp -rd binutils gdb

# We perhaps ought to allow an option to check out specific versions. For now
# just messages.
echo "All repositories cloned"
